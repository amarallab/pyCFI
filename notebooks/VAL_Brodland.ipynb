    "- ***Validation Data Investigations:***\n",
    "    - Why is there a case that loses 30pts during vector extraction? **[done]**\n",
    "        - Seems to be because it's an interface purely in a single z-plane (doesn't work for Brodland)\n",
    "    - Why are there cases where all three vectors are just in a line? **[done]**\n",
    "        - Also seems to be because it's an interface purely in a single z-plane (doesn't work for Brodland)\n",
    "        - Not sure why the problem this causes here is different to the one above...\n",
    "        - **Solution:** Exclude these problem cases from the very start!\n",
    "            - This leads to a much more clean set of TJs...\n",
    "            - ...but it also reduces the number of TJs quite substantially!\n",
    "            - Now there are only `2*10` equations for `27` interfaces; no good!\n",
    "    - See about also removing poor interfaces too, reducing the number of interfaces **[done]**\n",
    "        - Simply switching the initial selection to same-plane doesn't actually reduce the number\n",
    "        - This is because the interfaces are generally much bigger and stretch across multiple planes anyways\n",
    "        - Is there no way being a little less restrictive with the number of TJs removed...\n",
    "        - ...whilst still making sure the TJs kept are generally of decent quality?\n",
    "    - Does everything get better with a smoother segmentation? **[done]**\n",
    "        - Smoothing it with some dilation+erosion makes for a slight improvement\n",
    "        - It may be worth doing my own segmentation; their line enhancement filter is very suboptimal!\n",
    "    - Rather than removing the 3D component from the DN/TN search, remove TJs that don't go across `min_z` levels \n",
    "        - Something is wrong: a garbage TJ is being included!\n",
    "            - You forgot to double-check min_z also after the spline resampling and after the NaN exclusion!\n",
    "            - Also, you need to remove DJs, too! Otherwise they become the problem!\n",
    "        - With this fixed, the result no longer features crazy ridiculous outliers!\n",
    "        - This may be the most important bit to port to `Improved`\n",
    "    - *The result now no longer has carzy outliers but is still not really correlated with the Pipette data!*\n",
    "    - Maybe also add an absolute minimum size for DJs (based on some reasoning...) **[done]**\n",
    "    - Check the vectors; which ones are messy and why? *[done]*\n",
    "        - Issue 1: Incorrect angles/directionality due to non-adaptive query range *[fixed]*\n",
    "        - Issue 2: Incorrect handling of removed DJs due to defaultdict behavior *[fixed]*\n",
    "        - Issue 3: Sometimes there are too few/close-by neighbors for a TN so fitting fails *[fixed]*\n",
    "        - Issue 4: If the close-by neighbors are too \"blobby\" the fitting fails *[sort of fixed...]\n",
    "            - Added a way of removing these during arc fitting... but there are too many!\n",
    "            - There needs to be a way of having less crappy (broad) boundaries in the first place \n",
    "                - ~~Maybe the extracted outlines could be skeletonized~~ [doesn't work and is anyway questionable]\n",
    "                - No idea how to achieve this...\n",
    "            - \"Stupid\" solution: whenever there is an inscribed circle, just use the data's center of mass for the vector\n",
    "                - This is not very clean but it's an okay-ish fallback and also supercedes the straight-line exception\n",
    "    - Fix a bunch of issues related to angle wrapping (add `wrap_median` and use `wrap_sub` more often) **[done]**\n",
    "    - Check of how consistent a triplet consensus is; remove the ones that are poor **[done]**\n",
    "    - The fitted vectors are still very often not quite right! ***[YAH!]***\n",
    "        - Start by further improving the selection of the TN reference point ('proxy') during arc fitting!\n",
    "            - Try using the centroid of all points close to the spline point **[done]**!\n",
    "            - Increase the `close_points_radius` **[done]**\n",
    "            - Down-convert DEV and see whether remaining inconsistencies are present there as well **[done]**\n",
    "                - Nope; here the angles look very clear and correct!\n",
    "            - Prep the simulation data, run it through and see how things look there <font color=red>**[yah!]**</font>\n",
    "                - Maybe this will give clues for further improvement?\n",
    "    - How else to reduce noise???\n",
    "        - Could smooth interpolation of additional slices help? **[done]**\n",
    "            - This might make the boundaries less \"broad\" and add more options for consensus!\n",
    "            - Implementing this by means of a \"majority filter\" turned out harder than expected\n",
    "            - The current solution based on `skimage.filters.rank.windowed_histogram` seems decent, though\n",
    "            - The interpolation unfortunately produces some artifacts of its own...\n",
    "            - ...and thus doesn't really improve the end result much.\n",
    "            - This is unfortunate but hard to overcome (i.e. I can't think of a better interpolation method)\n",
    "        - Consider re-segmenting yourself to get a less messy segmentation... ***[next up after the above!]***\n",
    "        - Look through precision flags (and maybe robustness flags) for possible improvements?\n",
    "            - Switch the coordinate offset from 0.5 to 1.0 *[done*]"

    "Turns out spline fitting requires the input points to be roughly in order along the spline, which isn't guaranteed in our case. Ordering the points happens to be far harder problem than one might imagine (it's a variation of traveling salesman) but luckily it can be solved quite well with a Breadth-First Search (BFS). This solution is partially inspired by Imanol Luengo's answer to [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37742358/sorting-points-to-form-a-continuous-line).\n",

    "<font color=orange>**Warning 1:**</font> This will fail for geometries that exhibit \"crossings\" or \"forks\" of any kind. Although that should be very rare/non-existent in the data, a special form of \"fork\" is the circle. In case of a fully circular TJ, which occurs when two cells neatly touch each other, this will fail (unless some points are removed from the TJ). I couldn't come up with a way of fixing this but divised the `InvalidPathError` to at least pick up on such cases. However, **it may be too stringent** as it is currently implemented!\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=orange>**Warning 2:**</font> Simply rescaling the z axis a little bit already led to renewed problems with this approach, so I'm starting to seriously doubt its robustness. We'll have to keep a close eye on this and possibly somehow develop a better solution if problems keep cropping up. Maybe some sort of modified graph search (rather than straight up BFS) would be a possibility..."
